# Self Topography / Dynamics
Functions and example scripts for the paper The intrinsic Hierarchy of Self â€“ Converging Topography and Dynamics

# Step by step
1 - AFNI Preprocessing\
  example_preprocessing.sh: For @SSWarper and afni_proc.py\
  qinROIs.sh: Create ROI masks. Uses the Glasser atlas which is also in this folder\
  extract_data.sh: Extract time series from those masks.\
  example_interpolation.m: Linearly interpolate censored time points\
  \
2 - Dynamic Measures\
  Then calculate various measures from extracted data. See examples on examples.m
  
3 - Network Analysis\
  Calculate network measures strength and closeness on simulated signals.
