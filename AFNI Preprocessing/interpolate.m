function [int_ts] = interpolate(ts)
%% Interpolate Time Series
% This function interpolates censored time points. It was written with
% preprocessing via AFNI in mind, use with caution. This is a very lazily 
% written script using lots of for-loops and brute force, a more clever implementation
% is possible.
% I wrote this to account for 10 consecutive censored time points, but it's
% actually too much. I wouldn't recommend using it for, 5-6 consecutive
% points. Why would you keep a subject that can't sit still for 20 seconds
% anyway!
